{"name":"html-docx-js","tagline":"Converts HTML documents to DOCX in the browser","body":"html-docx-js\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a very small library that is capable of converting HTML documents to DOCX format that\r\nis used by Microsoft Word 2007 and onward. It manages to perform the conversion in the browser by\r\nusing mechanism called 'altchunk'. In a nutshell, it allows embedding content in a different markup\r\nlanguage. After Word opens such file, it converts the external content to Word Processing ML (this\r\nis how the markup language of DOCX files is called) and replaces the reference.\r\n\r\nAltchunks were not supported by Microsoft Word for Mac 2008 and are not supported by LibreOffice.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis library should work on any modern browser that supports `Blob`s (either natively or via \r\n[Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js/)). It was tested on Google Chrome 36, Safari 7 and\r\nInternet Explorer 10.\r\n\r\nIt also works on Node.js (tested on v0.10.12) using `Buffer` instead of `Blob`.\r\n\r\nUsage and demo\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSimple demo is available as `test/sample.html` in the repository and \r\n[online](http://evidenceprime.github.io/html-docx-js/sample.html).\r\n\r\n`html-docx-js` is distributed as 'standalone' Browserify module (UMD). You can `require` it as\r\n`html-docx`. If no module loader is available, it will register itself as `window.htmlDocx`.\r\nSee `test/sample.html` for details.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Evidence Prime, Inc.\r\nSee the LICENSE file for license rights and limitations (MIT).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
